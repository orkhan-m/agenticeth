## PumpNFT

The idea of the project is to give users opportunity to create their
own NFT collection in a few clicks without a need to create Art,
the task of generating and art is done by an AI. AI is designed to
create a collection which will use a "character" provided by the
user as a base image, and "features" provided by the user as a
variation of the collection images.
